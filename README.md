# CustomFuzzy

This program demonstrates the concept of fuzzy logic by simulating a cooling and heating system. 
A target and current temperature level are both added, and then the type of distribution is selected 
(Gaussian, Triangle, or Trapezoidal). The output is the rpm level of either cooling or heating.
This program utilizes an open source package from jFuzzyLogic.
